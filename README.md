15:34: The first thing I will need to do is setup a UI for testing. To begin, I want to have hard coded data which involves clickable categories that, when clicked, display their food_types

I'm looking at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm5Y7Vtuihg&t=476s for initial setup. Using npx create-expo-app@latest, I have a template for an app. I will edit the index.tsx script to display my main page.

16:24: Initial commit made with hard coded data working. Next, I want to change this to call from an sql database made in postgres. I will add the initial SQL script to the repo. I need to use node.js to accomplish this communication

Log 3/3
18:05: Backend added, including server running on port 3000. There is no polling or sockets yet

Next, I will look to add products under the food_types section
